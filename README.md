# Zmob

This is a game I made in high school (2006-2007). The code is awful and full of
whatever Java 2000-isms I picked up from the books I was reading. But damn if
it wasn't fun :)

I wrote a [blog
post](https://jeremykun.com/2012/03/15/learning-programming-zombies/) about
what my high school programming class was like.

To run the game:

```
javac game/ZombiesWindowed.java
java game/ZombiesWindowed.java
```

A simpler version (with no fancy sprites and less lag):

```
javac game/ZombiesWindowed.java
java game/ZombiesWindowed.java
```

The instructions are pretty complicated, but basically WASD for movement, shift
to run (stamina meter drains) and F5-F7 to start the game in one of the
difficulty modes. Mouse wheel or 1-6 will switch weapons, health/ammo drops
randomly, and F9 spawns a horde. Hit F2 for god mode.
