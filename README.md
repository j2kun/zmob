# Zmob

This is a game I made in high school (2006-2007). The code is awful and full of
whatever Java 2000-isms I picked up from the books I was reading.

To run

```
javac game/ZombiesWindowed.java
java game/ZombiesWindowed.java
```

A simpler version (with no images and less lag):

```
javac game/ZombiesWindowed.java
java game/ZombiesWindowed.java
```
